How would having access to malware source-code enable your research? SourceFinder is an initiative to enable malware research by identifying roughly 7500 public repositories (currently from GitHub) that contain malware source-code. These malware repositories were identified by our group and the details are provided in the peer-reviewed article below (RAID 2020). The platform supports a [light search capability] that provides the basic metadata of the repositories of interest. Note that the actual source-code can be retrieved from GitHub. For researchers interested in getting access to more data and our tools are cordially encouraged to contact us.
